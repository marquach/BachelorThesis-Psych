## Effects of measurement errors in covariates on linear regression

In nowadays psychology it is well known, that measurements are not self-evidently free of errors. An error is defined as the deviation from the true value. Therefore predictions are made with the use of variables containing errors. 

Measurement errors generally fall into two categories, random errors and systematic errors. The focus of this paper is set on the effects of random errors. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the effects of random measurement errors on linear regression, because these random errors lead to biased results. 

Furthermore, the influence of measurement errors on the quality of estimated values of the regression are investigated. In the following, the hypothese, that the estimators of the simple linear regression, derived from the ordinary least square method, are underestimated, when there is a measurement error in the independent variable, will be tested. 
The behaviour of the multiple linear regression under different conditions will be investigated. Both researches were conducted by the use of a simulation. 

The regression coefficient, derived from  the simple linear regression, was underestimated. Which can also be confirmed, by the correction of attenuation by Spearman. Moreover the paper shows, that a small explained variance $R^2$ lead to a weak power. The investigation of the multiple linear regression showed the over-/ and underestimation of the regression coefficients. The results of the multiple linear regression match the theory of classic suppression. 

In addition, during a small sample size the multiple regression led to a strong overestimation of the explained variance $R^2$. In summary it has been shown, that a correlation of the $X$-variables leads to a better estimator, under the condition, that they both show the same reliability and are used to explain the depended variable.
